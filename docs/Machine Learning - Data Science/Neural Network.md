This is a neural network implemented in python to recognize handwritten digits. The network is trained using the **MNIST** dataset available at **Kaggle**. It is created using **NumPy** and **Pandas**. It is implemented from scratch without using any deep learning libraries.

## Architecture

- Input layer: 784 neurons (28x28 pixels) arranged in the for of a matrix.

- Hidden layer: 10 neurons

- Output layer: 10 neurons (0-9)

## This neural network uses

- Forward propagation

- BackPropagation

- Gradient descent

- One-hot-encoding

## Activation functions

- ReLU

- SoftMax

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas

## Usage

- Clone the repository
- Run the `main.ipynb` file

## Metrics

**This neural network contains only one hidden layer and there is no regularization. There are a variety of ways to improve the accuracy of the network.**

- Accuracy: 84.5% (Training) and 81.9% (Testing)
