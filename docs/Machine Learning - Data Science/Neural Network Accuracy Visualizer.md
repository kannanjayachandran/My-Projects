Neural networks are a class of machine learning models that are inspired by the structure and function of the brain. Neural networks are used to solve a wide range of problems, including image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Recent advancement in the field of neural networks is behind almost all the recent breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence.

This is a simple application that visualizes the accuracy of a neural network I have created to recognize handwritten digits from the **MNIST** dataset. The neural network is created from scratch using only **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**. The neural network is trained using the **backpropagation** algorithm.

The **Neural Network Accuracy Visualizer** is a web application that visualizes the accuracy of the above neural network. The application is created using the **Streamlit** library.

### How to Use

- Enter a number between 0 and 42000 in the text box, this would be the index of the image in the MNIST dataset; then the image would be displayed along with the predicted label and the actual label. The predicted label is the label that the neural network predicts for the image, and the actual label is the label that the image actually has.
